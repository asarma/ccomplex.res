## Datasets

The datasets have been named like this:

_project_ - _type_ - _set_

* _project_ : can be either "jenk" or "vold". Self-explanatory
* _type_ : refers to the type of conflict considered, it can be "commit" (for merge conflict), "test" (for test failures) or "build" (for build failures)
* _set_ : it determines if the dataset contains all features ("all") or only the ones chosen by feature selection ("filtered")
